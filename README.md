# Glitchy Calculator

## Theme: Functionally Dysfunctional

Welcome to the Glitchy Calculator, a project created for the "Functionally Dysfunctional" hackathon theme. This calculator embodies the idea of "If it's stupid but it works... it isn't stupid."

## What is it?

The Glitchy Calculator is a 3D, moving calculator that challenges users to solve math problems before allowing them to see their calculation results. It's functional in that it can perform calculations, but dysfunctional in its presentation and user experience.

## Key Features

1. **3D Moving Interface**: The calculator floats and rotates in 3D space, adding an element of challenge to simple calculations.

2. **Floating Title**: A "Glitchy Calculator" title hovers above the calculator, swaying and rotating for added visual interest.

3. **Math Challenges**: Before revealing the result of a calculation, users must solve a randomly generated math problem.

4. **Streak System**: Keep track of how many challenges you've solved correctly in a row.

5. **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for incorrect answers and invalid calculations.

## Technology Stack
